# Section 2: Introduction to Node.js and NPM 

## Section Intro
- We will build a small and fun project, we won't worry about how things work behind the scenes, we will learn this in later sections

## What Is Node.js and Why Use It? 
- What is Node.js?
  - Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Google's open source V8 JavaScript Engine
- Node.js: JavaScript outside of the browser 
  - Browser 
  - Node.js outside of the browser 
    - V8 egine comes into play  
  - How the code in JS is executed 
- JavaScript on the server
  - Perfect conditions for using Node.js as a web server 
    - We can use JavaScript on the server-side of web development 
      - Build fast, highly scalable network applications (back-end)
- Why and when to use Node.js 
  - Node.js Pros 
    - Single-threaded, based on event driven, non-blocking I/O model 
    - Perfect for building fast and scalable data-intensive apps 
    - Companies like Netflix, Uber, PayPal, Ebay have started using node in production 
    - JavaScript across the entire stack: faster and more efficient development 
    - NPM: huge library of open-source packages available for everyone for free
    - Very active developer community 
  - Use Node.js 
    - API with database behind it (preferably NoSQL)
    - Data streaming (think YouTube)
    - Real-time chat application 
    - Server-side web application
  - Don't use 
    - Applications with heavy server-side processing (CPU intensive)
      - Rails 
      - php 
      - Python
